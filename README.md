This repo mostly contains various bash scripts that I use on a daily basis to make my digital life a little bit easier.

###spotify-contro###l

To make it useful you need to associate a keyboard combination  for the script, one for each argument; prev,next,pause etc... In the xfce desktop environment you can launch xfce4-keyboard-settings and under the "application shortcuts" tab add a keyboard shortcut for the script.

If you are using a different desktop environment where you don't have this functionality you can download and install 'xbindkeys'. http://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html.
