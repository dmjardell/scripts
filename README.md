SPOTIFY SCRIPTS
Enables you to use keyboard shortcuts to mute/unmute and change songs, without having the window selected.

1. Requires xdotools for sending keyboard events to the spotify window. Make sure that the window title in the script matches the window title of the spotify version you are using.

2. Go to your keyboard settings then under application shortcuts make a keyboard shortcut that executes the script(s). If that is not available try using xbindkeys.
